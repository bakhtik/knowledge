# Essentials of English Grammar

**Division of Grammar - Definitions - Etymology**

It is imperative that the fundamental principles of the Grammar be mastered. When we do not understand the grammar of the language, we may be making egregious (very bad and easily noticed) blunders while thinking we are speaking with the utmost accuracy.

## Divisions of Grammar

There are four great divisions of Grammar, viz.:

- *Orthography:* it treats of letters and the mode of combining them into words.
- *Etymology:* it treats of the various classes of words and the changes they undergo.
- *Syntax:* it treats of the connection and arrangement of words in sentences.
- *Prosody:* it treats of the manner of speaking and reading and the different kinds of verse.

The three first mentioned concern us most.

## Letters

A *letter* is a mark or character used to represent an articulate sound.

Letters are divided into

- *vowels:* a letter which makes a distinct sound by itself.
- *consonants:* they cannot by sounded without the aid of vowels.

The vowels are *a, e, i, o, u,* and sometimes *w* and *y* when they do not begin a word or syllable.
