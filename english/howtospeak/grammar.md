# Essentials of English Grammar

**Division of Grammar - Definitions - Etymology**

It is imperative that the fundamental principles of the Grammar be mastered. When we do not understand the grammar of the language, we may be making egregious (very bad and easily noticed) blunders while thinking we are speaking with the utmost accuracy.

## Divisions of Grammar

There are four great divisions of Grammar, viz.:

- *Orthography:* it treats of letters and the mode of combining them into words.
- *Etymology:* it treats of the various classes of words and the changes they undergo.
- *Syntax:* it treats of the connection and arrangement of words in sentences.
- *Prosody:* it treats of the manner of speaking and reading and the different kinds of verse.

The three first mentioned concern us most.

## Letters

A *letter* is a mark or character used to represent an articulate sound.

Letters are divided into

- *vowels:* a letter which makes a distinct sound by itself.
- *consonants:* they cannot by sounded without the aid of vowels.

The vowels are *a, e, i, o, u,* and sometimes *w* and *y* when they do not begin a word or syllable.

## Syllables and words

A syllable is a distinct sound produced by a single effort. In every syllable there must be at least one vowel.

A word consists of one syllable or a combination of syllables.

Division of words into syllable can be made by the organs of speech in properly pronouncing them.

## The parts of speech

### Article

An *Article* is a word placed before a noun to show whether the noun is used in a particular or general sense.

*A* or *an* is called the *indefinite article* because it does not point out any particular person of thing, but indicates the noun in its widest sense; thus, *a* man means any man.

*The* is called the *definite article* because it points out some particular person or thing; thus, *the* man means some particular individual.

### Noun

A *noun* is the name of any person, place or thing.

Nouns are:

- proper: applied to *particular* person or place
- common: applied to whole kind or species

Nouns are inflected (change the form of a word) by:

- number: 
  - one 
  - more than one
- gender: 
  - a male
  - a female
  - an inanimate object
  - something which has no distinctions of sex
- case:  
  - the state of the person, place, or thing represented
  - the subject of an affirmation or question
  - the owner or possessor of something mentioned
  - object of an action or of a relation

In the example, "John tore the leaves of Sarah's book":

- number: 
  - one *book*
  - many *leaves*
- gender: 
  - *John*, a male
  - *Sarah*, a female
  - *book* and *leaves* are inanimate things
- case:
  - *John*, the person who tore the book, the subject of the affirmation,
  - *Sarah*, the owner of the book
  - *leaves* the objects torn
  - *book* the object related to leaves, as the whole of which they were a part
