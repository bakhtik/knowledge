For all purposes of ordinary communication only about 2,000 words are required.

To use a big word or a foreign word when a small one and a familiar one will answer the same purpose, is a sign of ignorance. Great scholars and writers and polite speakers use simple words. 

Every person of intelligence should be able to use his mother tongue correctly. It only requires a little pains, a little care, a little study to enable one to do so, and the recompense is great.

## The English language in a nutshell

All the words in the English language are divided into nine great classes - Parts of Speech:

- Article
- Noun
- Adjective
- Pronoun
- Verb
- Adverb
- Preposition
- Conjunction
- Interjection

Of these, the Noun is the most important, as all the others are more or less dependent upon it.

*A Noun* signifies the name of any person, place or thing.

There are two kinds of Nouns:

- *Common* Nouns: names which belong in common to a race or class, as *man, city*. 
- *Proper* Nouns: they distinguish individual members of a race or class as *John, Philadelphia*. 

Nouns are varied by 

- *Person:* is that relation existing between the speaker, those addressed and the subject under consideration.
- *Number:* is the distinction of one from more than one.
- *Gender:* is the same relation to nouns that sex has to individuals.
- *Case:* is the relation one noun bears to another or to a verb or to a preposition.

The Persons are

- *First:* represent the speaker
- *Second:* represent the person addressed
- *Third:* represent the person or thing mentioned or under consideration

There are two numbers, *singular* and *plural*; singular denotes one, the plural two or more. The plural is generally formed from the singular by addition of *s* or *es*.

There are four genders, viz.:

- *masculine:* denotes all those of the male kind
- *feminine:* denotes all those of the female kind
- *neuter:* denotes inanimate (not living) things
- *common:* is applied to animate beings, the sex of which for the time being is indeterminable, such as fish, mouse, bird, etc.

*Personification* is a figure of speech when the noun which, properly speaking, belong to the neuter gender, is changed into either the masculine or feminine gender, as, for instance, *He* is rising (sun); *She* is setting (moon).

There are three cases:

- the *Nominative:* is the subject of which we are speaking or the agent which directs the action of the verb
- the *Possessive:* denotes possession
- the *Objective:* indicates the person or thing is affected by the action of the verb


An *Article* is a word placed before a noun to show whether the latter is used in a particular or general sense. There are but two articles: *a* or *an* and *the*.

An *Adjective* is a word which qualifies a noun, that is, which shows some distinguishing mark of characteristic belonging to the noun.

## Definitions

A *Pronoun* is a word used for or instead of a noun to keep us from repeating the same noun too often. Pronouns, like nouns, have case, number, gender, and person. There are three kinds of pronouns:

- *personal*
- *relative*
- *adjective*

A *verb* is a word which signifies action or the doing of something. A verb is inflected by tense and mood and by number and person, though the latter two belong strictly to the subject of the verb.

An *adverb* is a word which modifies a verb, and adjective and sometimes another adverb. For example, "accordingly", "usually", "tomorrow", "loudly", "slightly", "above", etc.

A *preposition* serves to connect words and to show the relation between the objects which the words express. For example, "above", "before", "since", etc.

A *conjunction* is a word which joins words, phrases, clauses and sentences together. For example, "and", "or".

A *interjection* is a word which expresses surprise or some sudden emotion of the mind. For example, "Ahh", "Hmm", "Really?", etc.

### Three essentials

The three essentials of the English language are:

- *Purity*
- *Perspicuity*
- *Precision*

By *Purity* is signified the use of good English. It precludes the use of all slang words, vulgar phrases, obsolete terms, foreign idioms, ambiguous expressions or any ungrammatical language whatsoever. Neither does it sanction the use of any newly coined word until such word is adopted by the best writers and speakers.

*Perspicuity* demands the clearest expression of thought conveyed in unequivocal (very strong and clear) language, so that there may be no misunderstanding whatever of the thought or idea the speaker of writer wishes to convey. All ambiguous words, words of double meaning are strictly forbidden. Perspicuity requires a style at once clear and comprehensive and entirely free from pomp (impressive things) and pedantry.

*Precision* requires concise and exact expression, free from redundancy and tautology, a style of terse (direct) and clear and simple enough to enable the hearer or reader to comprehend immediately the meaning of the speaker or writer. It forbids, on one hand, all long and involved sentences, and, on the other, those that too short and abrupt.
