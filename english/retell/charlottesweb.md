## Before Breakfast

We are meeting with the eight years old girl's, called Fern, family: Mr. Arable, Mrs. Arable, and her older ten years old brother, called Avery. 
Fern discovered that her father, Mr. Arable, wants to go away with the runt, smal and weak newborn piggy.
She saves the runt live. Mr. Arable decided to give his daughter chance to take care of that piggy by bringing it home in carton.
Fern called the runt Wilbur.

## Wilbur

Fern took care of Wilbur by feeding him with warmed milk. Wilbur quicky grown up and moved from home to the yard under the apple tree.
Parents forced her to sell Wilbur to Uncle Homer as the runt started to eat too much. Fern sold her pet to Mr. Zuckerman for six dollars.
