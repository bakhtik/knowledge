# Emotional Intelligence

## What are emotions for?

From the evolutionary biologists point of view, parental *self-sacrifice* serves to guarantee passing genes to future generations. But from the perspective of a parent it is about nothing other than *love*.

Our deepest feelings, our passions and longings (cravings) have an extraordinary power in human affairs. 

Our emotions guide us in facing predicaments (difficult situations) and task too important to leave to intellect alone - danger, painful loss, persisting toward a goal despite frustration. Survival value of our emotions is imprinted in us by evolution.

When it comes to shaping our decisions and our actions, feeling become as important, or sometimes more important, than thought.

### When passions overwhelm reason

One emotional legacy of evolution is the fear that mobilizes us to protect our family from danger. Human automatic reactions on sudden external events has etched (engraved) in our nervous system by evolution due to they made the difference between survival and death.

Since appearing human civilizations are trying to subdue (manage) human emotional nature. Our emotions have shaped by the slow and deliberate forces of evolution for million years. The last 10,000 years have left little imprint on our emotional templates. 

*Our behaviors and actions are shaped not just by our rational judgments or our personal history, but also by our distant ancestral past.*

## Impulses to action

All emotions, in essence, impulses to act, the instance plans for handling life that evolution has instilled in us. A tendency to act is implicit in every emotion.

In our emotional repertoire each emotion plays a unique role. Here some details of how each emotion prepares the body for a very different kind of response:

- **Anger:** blood flows to the hands, heart rate increases, a rush of hormones like *adrenaline* generates a pulse of energy for a vigorous action.
- **Fear:** blood goes to the large skeletal muscles like legs, the body freezes, a flood of hormones put the body on general alert, attention fixates on the threat. 
- **Happiness:** a quieting negative feelings for quick body recovery, rest, readiness and enthusiasm for the next endeavors.
- **Love:** tender feelings entail parasympathetic arousal - opposite to "fight-or-flight" mobilization.
- **Surprise:** lifting of the eyebrows to get more information about the unexpected event.
- **Disgust:** the upper lip curled in attempt to close the nostrils.
- **Sadness:** its function is to help adjust to a significant loss via dropping in energy and slowing down body's metabolism.

In the human prehistory emotions played a crucial role to survive in the ferocious environment. Nowadays, with relatively safe, emotional repertoire become less valuable. And frequently can impose more harm, like an anger of a thirteen-years-old with an automatic weaponry.
