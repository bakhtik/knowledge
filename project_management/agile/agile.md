# Agile Project Management

## A brief history of Agile

**Waterfall:**

The sequential of linear ordering of phases. You conduct one phase at a time.

**Agile:**

- Being able to move quickly and easily.
- Flexibility and the willingness and ability to change and adapt.

Agile uses **iterative** approach, which means the project processes are repeated often many times during project life cycle. This enables a project to move quickly and adapt to changes.

The Agile Manifesto declares the agile mindset with four values and 12 principles.

## Distinguishing Agile from Waterfall

| Waterfall | Agile |
|-----------|-------|
| Sequential | Iterative |
| Aims for predictability and tries to avoid changes. | Embraces that the reality is uncertain. |
| | Aims to get customer's feedback more quickly. |
| | Finding a ways to work more effectively. |
| | Aims to reduce waste. |

### Aspects of a project

| Waterfall | Agile |
|-----------|-------|
| **Requirements** | |
| Secured at the beginning and fixed. | Flexible and can be changed and/or re-prioritized along the project's course. |
| **Documentation** | |
| Big, formal documents with a rigorous change management and approval process. | Shorter documents that have just enough details to achieve their purpose. |
| **Deliverable** | |
| Released at the end of the project. | Smaller, more frequent releases. |
