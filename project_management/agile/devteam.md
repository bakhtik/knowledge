# Development Team

According to the Scrum Guide, Developers are "the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspects of a usable Increment each Sprint."

Their responsibilities include:

- Creating a plan for the Sprint, the *Sprint Backlog.*
- Instilling quality by adhering to a *Definition of Done.*
- Adapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal.
- Holding each other accountable as professionals.
- Executing Sprint by designing, building, and testing Product Backlog items in Increments.

Development Team is cross-functional, that is its team members specialized in different disciplines.

It is crucial for everyone on the team to understand their role and how they work together to deliver value.

## Developers' traits are:

- *Remain focus* on completing deliverable and producing superior final product.
- Eager to *work together*.
- Not afraid *to compromise* for the greater good of the product.

## A great Development Team

- **Applies team swarming method of working** where a team works on just a few items at a time, preferably even one item at a time. Each item is finished as quickly as possible.
- **Uses spike solutions.** A **spike** is a concise timeboxed activity used to discover work needed to accomplish a large ambiguous task. Team uses spike experiments to solve challenging technical, architectural, or design problems.
