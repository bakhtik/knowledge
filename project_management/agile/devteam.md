# Development Team

According to the Scrum Guide, Developers are "the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspects of a usable Increment each Sprint."

Their responsibilities include:

- Creating a plan for the Sprint, the *Sprint Backlog.*
- Instilling quality by adhering to a *Definition of Done.*
- Adapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal.
- Holding each other accountable as professionals.
- Executing Sprint by designing, building, and testing Product Backlog items in Increments.

Development Team is cross-functional, that is its team members specialized in different disciplines.

It is crucial for everyone on the team to understand their role and how they work together to deliver value.

## Developers' traits are:

- *Remain focus* on completing deliverable and producing superior final product.
- Eager to *work together*.
- Not afraid *to compromise* for the greater good of the product.

## A great Development Team

- **Pursues technical excellence.** Use Extreme Programming as a source of inspiration.
- **Applies team swarming method of working** where a team works on just a few items at a time, preferably even one item at a time. Each item is finished as quickly as possible.
- **Uses spike solutions.** A **spike** is a concise timeboxed activity used to discover work needed to accomplish a large ambiguous task. Team uses spike experiments to solve challenging technical, architectural, or design problems.
- **Refines the product backlog as a team.**
- **Respect the Boy Scout Rule.** "Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it." Clean up messy code.
- **Criticizes ideas, not people.**
- **Shares experience.**
- **Understands the importance of having some slack.** Build in some slack into the Sprint!
- **Has fun with each other:** fostering fun, energy, interaction and collaboration.
- **Don't have any Scrum "meetings".** Consider Scrum events as opportunities for conversations to *plan, align,* and to *reflect.*
- **Knows their customers.** Real customers are in direct contact with the team.
- **Can explain the (business) value of non-functional requirements** such as performance, security, and scalability.
- **Trusts each other.**
- **Keeps retrospective fun.**
- **Deliver features during the Sprint.** Team delivers features *continuously.*

- **Spends time on innovation.** Team knows it's necessary to keep up with rapidly changing environment and technology. 
- **Doesn't need a Definition of Done.** Team deeply understands what "done" means for them. The only reason to use it is to make the "done state" transparent for their stakeholders.
- **Knows how to give feedback.** Team has learned how to give each other feedback honestly and respectfully. They grasp the concept of the "Situation-Behavior-Impact Feedback Tool" and therefore provide clear, actionable feedback.
- **Manages their team composition.** Whenever specific skill are necessary, they collaborate with other teams to discuss the opportunities of "hiring" specific skills.
- **Proactive collective ownership.** They rotate developers across different modules of the application and systems to encourage collective ownership.
