# The Agile Manifesto

- [The Four Values](#the-four-values)
- [The Twelve Principles](#the-twelve-principles)

The Manifesto was created on February 13, 2001 at ski resort in the Wasatch mountains of Utah by the collaboration of seventeen people.

## The Four Values

**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.

**Working software** over comprehensive documentation.

**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.

**Responding to change** over following a plan.

That is, while there is a value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

It's up to you to find the *right balance* between the two sides.

### Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

The preference shall be on communicating people with each other over using lots of processes and tools.

- Work together
- Collaborate
- Support each other to achieve outcomes
- Value individual perspectives and creativity

### Working software over comprehensive documentation

Teams should more work on things that actually create value and avoid spending more time then needed on writing and reviewing documents.

### Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

Focus is on identifying what's really needed via collaborative and customer-focus work.

- Collaborate with customer early and often
- React and adapt to feedback

### Responding to change over following a plan

Plans can be revisited and adapted at any time during the project.

- Changes are inevitable
- Adapt to change at any time

## The Twelve Principles

All twelve principles can be grouped in four themes:

1. **Value Delivery.** How do Agile teams deliver highly valuable product to their customers?
2. **Business Collaboration.** How do Agile teams collaborate with their business partners and stakeholders to create value?
3. **Team Dynamics and Culture.** How does a team create and maintain the right interpersonal and team dynamics?
4. **Retrospectives and Continuous Learning.** How does the project learn to continuously increase performance of the business?

### Value Delivery

- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference for the shorter timescale.
- Working software is the primary measure of progress.
- Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential.
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

Delivery the work as quickly as possible in order to get feedback and mitigate time risk.

Simplicity allows a team to work on the things that matter most. The team should avoid implementing extra features that weren't explicitly requested. This includes removing procedures that no longer necessary, and reducing unnecessary documentation.

### Business Collaboration

- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development, Agile processes harness (exploit) change for the customer's competitive advantage.
- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

Collaborating with your customers helps the team get critical business information immediately, allowing them to adjust and adapt to any new information instantly.

Rather than trying to keep the customers away from developers do to concerns about scope creep, create a weekly huddle (group) where customers and business people can explore feedback and new ideas with the team.

Make sure that business people work near the development team.

### Team Dynamics and Culture

- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
- Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

Create an effective team culture that is inclusive, supportive, and empowering.

Make sure your team:

- is motivated to do the right thing
- feels trusted to do the right thing
- has resources and space to work closely together on their goals
- works at a sustainable pace

Let the team write their *own* processes and templates.

### Retrospectives and Continuous Learning

- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

Strive to continuously learn and adapt to what's working and what's not.

#### Questions for improvement

- How is team doing?
- Are the customer happy?
- Are there processes we could optimize?
- Are our tools working for us?
- Are we following the values?
- Are we accumulating any debt, technical or otherwise?

*Debt* is a process or technology that slows us down.
