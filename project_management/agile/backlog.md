# Building a Product Backlog

Product Backlog
: The simple authoritative source for things that a team works on. It contains all of the features, requirements, and activities associated with deliverables to achieve the goal of the project.

Three key features:

- **Living artifact.**  It evolves throughout the whole life cycle of the project.
- **Owned and adjusted by the Product Owner.**
- **Prioritized list of features.** The items at the *top* of the list are *very specific and well-defined*, leaving more *vague* items at the *bottom* of the list.

The Product Backlog is the guide and roadmap of your project. It's a central artifact in the Scrum.

The best practices and pieces of data:

- The description
- The value
- The order
- The estimate
