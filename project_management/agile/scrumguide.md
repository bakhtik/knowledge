# Scrum Guide

## Scrum

Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.

Scrum requires a Scrum Master to foster an environment where:

1. A [Product Owner](#product-owner) order the work for a complex problem into a [Product Backlog](#product-backlog).
2. The [Scrum Team](#scrum-team) turns a selection of the work into an [Increment](#increment) of value during a [Sprint](#the-sprint).
3. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.
4. *Repeat.*

While implementing only parts of Scrum is possible, the result is not Scrum. Scrum exists only in its entirety and functions well as a container for other techniques, methodologies, and practices.

## Scrum Team

The Scrum Team consists of one [Scrum Master](#scrum-master), one [Product Owner](#product-owner) , and [Developers](#developers). It is a cohesive unit of professionals focused on one objective at a time, the [Product Goal](#product-goal-commitment).

The Scrum Team is responsible for all product-related activities from stakeholder collaboration, verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development, etc.

## Developers

Developers are the people in the [Scrum Team](#scrum-team) that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable [Increment](#increment) each [Sprint](#the-sprint).

Developers are accountable for:

- Creating a plan for the Sprint, the [Sprint Backlog](#sprint-backlog);
- Providing quality by complying to a [Definition of Done](#definition-of-done-commitment);
- Adapting their plan each day toward the [Sprint Goal](#sprint-goal-commitment);
- Respecting each other as professionals.

## Product Owner

The Product Owner is accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum.

The Product Owner is accountable for the effective [Product Backlog](#product-backlog) management:

- Developing and explicitly communication the [Product Goal](#product-goal-commitment);
- Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog items;
- Ordering Product Backlog items;
- Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood.

## Scrum Master

The Scrum Master is accountable for:

- *establishing Scrum* by helping everyone understand Scrum theory and practice;
- the *Scrum Team's effectiveness* by enabling [Scrum Team](#scrum-team) to improve its practices.

The Scrum Master serves the Scrum Team:

- Coaching the team self-management and cross-functionality;
- Helping the team focus on creating Increments that meet the [Definition of Done](#definition-of-done-commitment);
- Causing the removal of impediments;
- Ensuring that all [Scrum events](#scrum-events) take place and are positive, productive, and kept within the timebox.

The Scrum Master serves the [Product Owner](#product-owner):

- Helping find ways to improve [Product Goal](#product-goal-commitment) definition and [Product backlog](#product-backlog) management;
- Influence the team to maintain clear and concise Product Backlog items;
- Helping establish empirical product planning;
- Facilitating stakeholder collaboration;

The Scrum Master serves the organization:

- Leading, training, and coaching for the Scrum adoption;
- Planning and advising Scrum implementations;
- Helping understand and enact an empirical approach for complex work;
- removing barriers between stakeholders and Scrum Teams.

## Scrum Events

The Sprint is a container for all other events. Each event in Scrum is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt Scrum artifacts.

Optimally, all events are held at the same time and place to reduce complexity.

Scrum events are:

- the [Sprint](#the-sprint)
- the [Sprint Planning](#sprint-planning)
- the [Daily Scrum](#daily-scrum)
- the [Sprint Review](#sprint-review), and
- the [Sprint Retrospective](#sprint-retrospective)

## The Sprint

All the work necessary to achieve the [Product Goal](#product-goal-commitment), including Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective, happen within [Sprint](#the-sprint). They are fixed length events of one months or less to create consistency.

Each Sprint may be considered a short project.

## Sprint Planning

Sprint Planning initiates the Sprint by laying out the work to be performed for the Sprint.

Sprint Planning addresses the following topics:

- **Why is this Sprint valuable?**
  - How the product could increase its value;
  - Defining a [Sprint Goal](#sprint-goal-commitment), valuable to stakeholders;
- **What can be Done this Sprint?**
  - Selecting items from the [Product Backlog](#product-backlog) to include in the current Sprint;
  - Selecting how much can be completed within a Sprint;
- **How will the chosen work get done?**
  - Decomposing Product Backlog items into smaller work items of one day or less;

The outcome of the event is the Sprint Backlog that includes the Sprint Goal, the selected Product Backlog items, plus the plan for delivering them

Sprint Planning is timeboxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint.

## Daily Scrum

The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event to inspect progress towards the [Sprint Goal](#sprint-goal-commitment) and adapt the [Sprint Backlog](#sprint-backlog) if necessary.

To foster focus and self-management, it's advisable to allow [Developers](#developers) to select appropriate event format by themselves.

Daily Scrums improve communications, identify impediments, and promote quick decision-making.

## Sprint Review

The [Scrum Team](#scrum-team) presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress towards the [Product Goal](#product-goal-commitment) is discussed.

Based on the information, attendees collaborate on what to do next. The Sprint Review is a working session, not just presentation of the outcomes.

The Sprint Review should not be considered a gate to releasing value.

It is timeboxed to a maximum of four hours for a one-month [Sprint](#the-sprint).

## Sprint Retrospective

The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness.

The [Scrum Team](#scrum-team) inspects how the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their [Definition of Done](#definition-of-done-commitment). The Scrum Team discusses what went well during the [Sprint](#the-sprint), what problems it encountered, and how whose problems were (or were not) solved.

The most impactful improvements can be added to the [Sprint Backlog](#sprint-backlog) of the next Sprint.

The Sprint Retrospective concludes the Sprint. It is timeboxed to a maximum of three hours for a one-month Sprint.

## Scrum Artifacts

Scrum's artifacts represent work or value and are designed to maximize transparency of key information.

| Artifact | Its focus |
|----------|-----------|
| the Product Backlog | the Product Goal |
| the Sprint Backlog | the Sprint Goal |
| the Increment | the Definition of Done |

## Product Backlog

The Product Backlog is an emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product.

Product Backlog refinement is the act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog items into smaller more precise items.

## Product Goal (commitment)

The Product Goal describes a future state of the product which can serve as a target for the [Scrum Team](#scrum-team) to plan against. The Product Goal is in the [Product Backlog](#product-backlog). The rest of the Product Backlog emerges to define "what" will fulfill the Product Goal.

The Product Goal is the long-term objective for the Scrum Team. They must fulfill (or abandon) one objective before taking on the next.

## Sprint Backlog

The Sprint Backlog is composed of the [Sprint Goal](#sprint-goal-commitment) (why), the set of [Product Backlog](#product-backlog) items selected for the Sprint (what), as well as an actionable plan for delivering the [Increment](#increment) (how). The Spring Backlog is updated throughout the Sprint as more is learned. It should have enough detail that they can inspect their progress in the [Daily Scrum](#daily-scrum).

## Sprint Goal (commitment)

The Sprint Goal is the single objective for the [Sprint](#the-sprint). The Sprint Goal creates coherence and focus, encouraging the [Scrum Team](#scrum-team) to work together rather than on separate initiatives.

As the Developers work during the Sprint, they keep the Sprint Goal in mind.

## Increment

An Increment is a concrete stepping stone towards [Sprint Goal](#sprint-goal-commitment). Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and must be usable.

Multiple Increments may be created within a [Sprint](#the-sprint).

Work cannot be considered part of an Increment unless it meets the Definition of Done.

## Definition of Done (commitment)

The Definition of Done is a formal description of state of the [Increment](#increment) when it meets the quality measures required for the product.

It creates transparency by providing a shared understanding of what work was completed as part of the Increment. Incomplete items shall not be presented at the [Sprint Review](#sprint-review), but return to the [Product Backlog](#product-backlog).

The [Developers](#developers) are required to conform to the Definition of Done.
