## Introduction: Scrum 101

**Scrum** refers to a formation in rugby where all players in the team lean forward, lock their heads together, and then work as **one unit** to try and gain precious yards towards the scoring line.

When you use Scrum, you form a team that will **work together** to **quickly develop** and **test** a deliverable. The work is completed in **short cycles**, and the team **meets daily** to discuss current tasks and clear up anything that's blocking their progress.

**Scrum Guide** is a main source of truth for Scrum teams. Available at (https://scrumguides.org).

Agile is the foundational philosophy and mindset, while Scrum is a framework that materializes or brings that philosophy to life.

Scrum theory consists of:

- three pillars, and
- five values

Scrum Team roles are:

- Product Owner
- Scrum Master
- Development Team

In Scrum projects, project managers typically take on the Scrum Master role.

## The three pillars of Scrum

**Scrum** is framework for developing, delivery, and sustaining complex products.

Scrum uses an iterative and incremental approaches.

**Iterative:** repeating cycles of delivery.

**Incremental:** work is divided into smaller chunks, that build on each other.

The product is build over time through work done during each **iteration.** Each of these instances of the product is called an **increment.**

Scrum is based on the empiricism theory. **Empiricism** is the idea that true knowledge comes from actual, lived experience.

Each iteration and increment is understand as a mini-experiment, where we can learn really valuable things to help improve the project.

The pillars of Scrum are:

- Transparency
- Inspection
- Adaptation

### Transparency

Make the most significant aspects of our work visible to those responsible for the outcomes.

Transparency inside a Scrum team is critical to the team's productivity and the project's completion.

Transparency builds a level of trust, and encourages more collaboration and fewer mistakes.

### Inspection

Conducting timely checks towards the outcome of a Sprint goal to detect undesirable variances.

We're always checking in our progress and deliverables.

The more inspections that take place, the more improvements a team experiences in their work.

### Adaptation

Adjusting project, product, or processes to minimize any further deviation or issues.

In Scrum, and in Agile, we embrace change, so that we are always improving. So when we adapt, we change aspects that do not work or could be better.

## The five values of Scrum

1. Commitment
2. Courage
3. Focus
4. Openness
5. Respect

### Commitment

Personally committing to achieving the goals of the Scrum team

### Courage

The Scrum team members must have the courage to do the right thing and work on though problems.

### Focus

Everyone focusing on the work of the Sprint and the overall goal of the Scrum team.

The Scrum Master helps the team to focus on the Sprint and product goals by facilitating their activities and events on a daily basis.

### Openness

The Scrum team and its stakeholders agree to be open about all of the work and challenges with performing the work.

### Respect

Team members should respect the opinions, skills, and independence of their teammates.

In order for a team to bring the three pillars of Scrum to life, they must act in accordance with the five Scrum values.

| Pillars | Values |
|---------|--------|
| Transparency| *Open* to sharing information and *focus* to share most relevant information |
| Inspection | *Courage* to offer difficult feedback and mutual *respect* to really listen |
| Adaptation | *Courage* to make changes and *be committed* to the goals |

## Scrum roles and responsibilities

The best way to motivate individuals is to give them a **mission** and a **product vision** that they really care about.

Mission
: A short statement that stays constant for your team throughout the process and gives them something to work toward. A mission tells me **why** we're doing the work.

Product Vision
: When you set a vision, you're making it clear **what** the team is responsible for and where your team's boundaries are. It helps me imagine **what** the work will be like when we're done.

Scrum Team roles:

- Scrum Master
- Product Owner
- Development Team (or Developers)

As a collective, Scrum Team exhibits specific skills:

- **cross-functional**
- **self-organizing** 
- accomplishments are of the **entire team**

### Scrum Master

A Scrum Master promotes and supports the Scrum process by helping understand and implement Scrum. This includes its practices, rules, and values.

A Scrum Master is responsible for:

- Coaching team members on Agile and Scrum practices, rules, and values.
- Helping to find ways to manage Product Backlog effectively.
- Facilitating Scrum events.
- Helping the Team remove blockers.
- Preventing unhelpful interactions from outside of the team.
- Making clear of everyone's roles and responsibilities.
- Ensuring we're working towards the same goal.
- Stakeholder management.

Scrum Master's traits are:

- Organizational skills to effectively organize project artifacts and manage Scrum events.
- Supportive leaders who focus on the need of others and the needs of the team before their own needs.
- Facilitate productivity and collaboration. Ensure every team member's voice is heard and that their input is addressed.
- Great communicators and teachers.
- Great influential person.

### Product Owner

A Product Owner is tasked with ensuring that the team is building the **right** product or service.

A Product Owner's responsibilities are:

- Continuously maximizes the value of the product. Their key activity is acting as the **voice** of the customer withing the team through the **ownership** of the **Product Backlog**.
- Helps the Scrum Team understand **why** their work matters within the overall goal and mission.
- Prioritizes the Product Backlog to optimize delivery and value to customers.
- Ensures the Backlog is visible and transparent to all.
- Makes sure the product or service fulfills the customers' needs.

Product Owner's traits:

- **Customer-focused,** so that they must understand a **customer's needs** and the **industry of their business** extremely well.
- **Decisive** (convincing), great communicators, and understand both sides of the issue so they can **defend** their decisions to the team.
- **Flexible** and open to new information that can generate a profitable change for the team.
- **Optimistic** and **positive,** especially since they're delivering the product vision to the team. And they must **inspire** the team to believe in the mission.
- **Available.** The iterative nature of Scrum means that the team needs the Product Owner to help **inspect, adapt,** and **plan** the next iteration on a **regular basis.**
- **Collaborative.** To ensure customer's needs are met it is required meeting with and working alongside several stakeholders.

### Development Team

The people who do the work to build the product.

The size of the team ranges from **three** to **nine** people. This ensures that the team is small enough to remain nimble (quick and flexible), but large enough to complete **significant** work within each Sprint.

Development Team's traits:

- **Cross-functional.** To do things *in-house* the team shall has *all* of the required skills.
- **Self-organizing.** Team owns their processes and structures.
- **Supportive.** They continuously operate as a team, rather than individuals.
- **Customer-oriented.** The best products emerge from focusing on the user.

## Scrum main events and artifacts

### Product Backlog

The central artifact in Scrum, where all possible ideas, deliverables, features, or tasks are captured for the team to work on.

It's prioritized and proactively managed by the team continuously throughout the life of the project.

### Sprint

A time-boxed iteration in Scrum where work is done.

This Sprint can be between one and four weeks long, but most Sprints are around **two weeks**. This is often called **iteration**.

### Daily Scrum

A meeting of **15** or fewer minutes every day of the Sprint to inspect team's progress towards their goals.
