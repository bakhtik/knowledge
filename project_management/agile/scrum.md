## Introduction: Scrum 101

**Scrum Guide** is a main source of truth for Scrum teams. Available at https://scrumguides.org.

Agile is the foundational philosophy and mindset, while Scrum is a framework that materializes or brings that philosophy to life.

Scrum theory consists of:

- three pillars, and
- five values

Scrum Team roles are:

- Product Owner
- Scrum Master
- Development Team

In Scrum projects, project managers typically take on the Scrum Master role.

## The three pillars of Scrum

**Scrum** is framework for developing, delivery, and sustaining complex products.

Scrum uses an iterative and incremental approaches.

**Iterative:** repeating cycles of delivery.

**Incremental:** work is divided into smaller chunks, that build on each other.

The product is build over time through work done during each **iteration.** Each of these instances of the product is called an **increment.**

Scrum is based on the empiricism theory. **Empiricism** is the idea that true knowledge comes from actual, lived experience.

Each iteration and increment is understand as a mini-experiment, where we can learn really valuable things to help improve the project.

The pillars of Scrum are:

- Transparency
- Inspection
- Adaptation

### Transparency

Make the most significant aspects of our work visible to those responsible for the outcomes.

Transparency inside a Scrum team is critical to the team's productivity and the project's completion.

Transparency builds a level of trust, and encourages more collaboration and fewer mistakes.

### Inspection

Conducting timely checks towards the outcome of a Sprint goal to detect undesirable variances.

We're always checking in our progress and deliverables.

The more inspections that take place, the more improvements a team experiences in their work.

### Adaptation

Adjusting project, product, or processes to minimize any further deviation or issues.

In Scrum, and in Agile, we embrace change, so that we are always improving. So when we adapt, we change aspects that do not work or could be better.

## The five values of Scrum

1. Commitment
2. Courage
3. Focus
4. Openness
5. Respect

### Commitment

Personally committing to achieving the goals of the Scrum team

### Courage

The Scrum team members must have the courage to do the right thing and work on though problems.

### Focus

Everyone focusing on the work of the Sprint and the overall goal of the Scrum team.

The Scrum Master helps the team to focus on the Sprint and product goals by facilitating their activities and events on a daily basis.

### Openness

The Scrum team and its stakeholders agree to be open about all of the work and challenges with performing the work.

### Respect

Team members should respect the opinions, skills, and independence of their teammates.

In order for a team to bring the three pillars of Scrum to life, they must act in accordance with the five Scrum values.

| Pillars | Values |
|---------|--------|
| Transparency| *Open* to sharing information and *focus* to share most relevant information |
| Inspection | *Courage* to offer difficult feedback and mutual *respect* to really listen |
| Adaptation | *Courage* to make changes and *be committed* to the goals |

## Scrum roles and responsibilities

The best way to motivate individuals is to give them a **mission** and a **product vision** that they really care about.

Mission
: A short statement that stays constant for your team throughout the process and gives them something to work toward. A mission tells me **why** we're doing the work.

Product Vision
: When you set a vision, you're making it clear **what** the team is responsible for and where your team's boundaries are. It helps me imagine **what** the work will be like when we're done.

Scrum Team roles:

- Scrum Master
- Product Owner
- Development Team (or Developers)
