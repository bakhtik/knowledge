No other organization has the same collections of people, norms, processes, state, impediments, values, history, folklore, etc. as yours does.

Individual and collective behaviors mutate and self-organize on a change-initiating event. Interventions are irreversible, like adding milk to coffee. The system learns and changes. Not only are your contexts unique, they are constantly changing and changing how they change.

With this uniqueness, emergence, and adaptation, it is not possible to have one set of practices which will optimize outcomes for every context. One size does not fit all.

For lasting improvement and to apply an agile mindset to agility, the locus of control needs to be internal. People need to have autonomy and empowerment within guardrails to be able to experiment in order to improve on desired outcomes.

Evolution over revolution stands a chance of progress. Revolution will struggle; with a lack of psychological safety, the antibodies will be strong.

Disciplined Agile (DA) enables a heterogeneous approach. It includes principles of 

- "choice is good"
- "context counts"
- "enterprise awareness"

People needs

- to think rather than follow orders
- to take ownership
- to experiment

to achieve specific outcomes, not purse agile for agile's sake.

This is harder than following a prescription or a *diktat*. It requires

- servant leadership, and
- coaching

The job you are hiring Disciplined Agile to do is to enable context-sensitive, heterogeneous approaches to agility.

Lets reflect for the current state of agile product development in someone's context using sailboat retrospection method.

There are several things that can holding us back:

1. **Product development is complex.** We must address how to approach requirements, architecture, testing, design, programming, management, deployment, etc.
2. **Agile industrial complex (AIC).** The era of AIC is when prescriptive agile frameworks are routinely imposed upon a teams. You can't solve complex problem by applying a simple solution.
3. **Agile growth greatly exceeded the supply of experienced coaches.**

Things that could cause us to run aground:

- **False promises.** Despite marketing claims, real performance gain of employing agile approaches, on average, is about 7-12% on smaller teams and 3-5% at scale.
- **More silver bullets.** There is no silver bullet for the software development. What you do need are skilled, knowledgeable, and hopefully experienced people working together effectively.
- **Process populism.** Most agile methods and frameworks are prescriptive, regardless of their marketing claims.

Things that are the "winds in our sails" that propel us read this book:

- **It embrace your uniqueness.** No more false promises of a "one-size-fits-all" process.
- **It embrace the complexity you face.** And present an accessible representation to help guide your process improvement efforts.
- **It provides explicit choices.** This book presents a proven strategy for guided continuous improvement (GCI), a team-based process improvement strategy. 
- **It provides agnostic advice.** Our philosophy is to look for great ideas regardless of their source and to recognize that there are no best practices.
