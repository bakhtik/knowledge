## Why Should Teams Choose Their WoW?

Agile teams shall own their process, choose their WoW:

- **Context counts.** People and teams will work differently depending on the context of their situation, i.e. team size, regulatory/nonregulatory situation, people's skill sets, preferences, and backgrounds.
- **Choice is good.** To be effective, a team must be able to choose the practices and strategies to address the situation that they face based on:
  - the trade-offs of each of the approaches
  - when (or when not) to apply each one
- **We should optimize flow.** We need to optimize workflow within our team and in how we collaborate with other teams across the organization in order be be effective.
- **We want to be awesome.** A significant part of peoples' motivation to be effective is to enable teams to choose their WoW and to allow them to constantly experiment to identify even better ways they can work.

Many teams are forced to follow a "faux agile" strategy as organizations are adopting some prescriptive frameworks like Scrum. Yet canonical agile is very clear; it's individuals and interactions over processes and tools - teams should be allowed, and better yet, supported, to choose and then evolve their WoW.

## You Need to "Be Agile" *and* Know How to "Do Agile"

Agile mindset (by the analogy of what has a group of kids) implies:

- be respectful
- be open-minded
- be collaborative
- be eager to learn

It's absolutely critical to have an agile mindset, to "be agile", but you also need to have the requisite *skills* to "do agile" and the *experience* to "do enterprise agile".

The real goal is to effectively achieve *desired organizational outcomes*, not to be/do agile.
