# Choosing Your WoW!

## Key Points

- Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD) teams have the autonomy to choose their way of working (WoW).
- You need to "be agile" and know how to "do agile".
- Software development is complicated; there's no easy answer for how to do it.
- Disciplined Agile (DA) provides the scaffolding - a tool kit of agnostic advice - to Choose WoW.
- Other people have faced, and overcome similar challenges to yours. DA enables you to leverage their learnings.
- You can use this book to guide how to initially choose your WoW and then evolve it over time.
- The real goal is to effectively achieve desired organizational outcomes, not to be/do agile.
- Better decisions lead to better outcomes.

## Why Should Teams Choose Their WoW?

Agile teams shall own their process, choose their WoW:

- **Context counts.** People and teams will work differently depending on the context of their situation, i.e. team size, regulatory/nonregulatory situation, people's skill sets, preferences, and backgrounds.
- **Choice is good.** To be effective, a team must be able to choose the practices and strategies to address the situation that they face based on:
  - the trade-offs of each of the approaches
  - when (or when not) to apply each one
- **We should optimize flow.** We need to optimize workflow within our team and in how we collaborate with other teams across the organization in order be be effective.
- **We want to be awesome.** A significant part of peoples' motivation to be effective is to enable teams to choose their WoW and to allow them to constantly experiment to identify even better ways they can work.

Many teams are forced to follow a "faux agile" strategy as organizations are adopting some prescriptive frameworks like Scrum. Yet canonical agile is very clear; it's individuals and interactions over processes and tools - teams should be allowed, and better yet, supported, to choose and then evolve their WoW.

## You Need to "Be Agile" *and* Know How to "Do Agile"

Agile mindset (by the analogy of what has a group of kids) implies:

- be respectful
- be open-minded
- be collaborative
- be eager to learn

It's absolutely critical to have an agile mindset, to "be agile", but you also need to have the requisite *skills* to "do agile" and the *experience* to "do enterprise agile".

The real goal is to effectively achieve *desired organizational outcomes*, not to be/do agile.

## Accept That There's No Easy Answer

What we do is challenging:

- You and your team work within the context of organization
- Technologies you are using is constantly evolving
- You're working with different people and organizations what act differently

To be effective you should embrace (accept with pleasure) this complexity and not downplay or ignore important aspects of your WoW.

## We Can Benefit From the Learning of Others

Development teams utilize proven frameworks and libraries to improve productivity and quality. It should be the same thing with process. You can develop your WoW by combining existing practices and strategies and then modifying them to address the situation at hand.

## DA Knowledge Makes You a Far More Valuable Team Member

Understanding a larger library of proven strategies means that teams will make better decisions and "fail fast" less, rather "learn and succeed earlier." Every team member is expected to bring a tool kit of ideas to customize the team's process as part of self-organization.

## The Disciplined Agile (DA) Tool Kit Provides Accessible Guidance

Tool kit applying:

- Contextualized process reference
- Guided continuous improvement (GCI)
- Process-tailoring workshops
- Enhanced retrospectives
- Enhanced coaching

## Contextualized Process Reference

Three level of scaffolding to quickly reference available strategies:

1. **Life cycles.** DAD supports six different life cycles to provide flexibility with choosing an approach:
  - Agile
  - Continuous Delivery: Agile
  - Exploratory
  - Lean
  - Continuous Delivery: Lean
  - Program 
2. **Process goals.** DAD is described as a collection of 24 process goals (outcomes). Each goal is described as a collection of decision points, issues to be addressed and how to address them. 
3. **Practices/strategies.** Potential practices/strategies for addressing a decision point are presented as lists. Goal diagrams are guides to choose the best strategies with indication of relative effectiveness of options. You don't need to have deep knowledge of each option as they overviewed in the Disciplined Agile Browser.

## Improvement Occurs at Many Levels

Your organization is a complex adaptive system (CAS), with interaction of evolving teams/groups.

Implications for choosing your WoW:

1. **Every team will have a different WoW.**
2. **We will evolve our WoW to reflect learning whenever we work with other teams.**
3. **We can purposefully choose to learn from other teams.** Strategies to share learning across teams:
  - Practitioner presentations
  - Communities of practice (CoPs)/guilds
  - Coaching, etc.
4. **We can benefit from organizational transformation/improvement efforts.** Improvement can, and should, happen at the team level. But it also needs to occur outside of DAD teams and at the organizational level to collaborate effectively.

DA tool kit is organized into four layers:

1. **Foundation.** Conceptual underpinnings (basis) of the DA tool kit.
2. **Disciplined DevOps.** DevOps is the streamlining of solution development and operations.
3. **Value Stream.** Based on FLEX - the glue that ties organization's strategies, showing what an effective value stream look like.
4. **Disciplined Agile Enterprise(DAE).** The layer focuses on the rest of the enterprise activities.

## Guided Continuous Improvement (GCI)


## Process-Tailoring Workshops

## Enhance Retrospectives Through Guided Improvement Options

## Enhance Coaching by Extending the Coach's Process Tool Kit

## Documenting Your WoW

Reasons for documenting are:

1. **Regulatory.**
2. **It's too complicated to remember.**
3. **It provides comfort.**
