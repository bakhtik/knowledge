# The Organizational Environment

**"In good company"**

Types of organizational structures:

Organic
: small organization, PM as part-time, low authority PM

Functional
: functional manager act as PM, a lot of administrative work

Multidivisional
: each division as a separate organization, P< acts as a project coordinator. Functional manager decides

Weak matrix
: PM has some authority, functional manager still approves

Balanced matrix
: shared responsibility between PM and functional manager

Strong matrix
: PM has more authority that functional manager

Project-oriented
: PM makes all of the decisions and responsibility for success

PMP exam assumes you work in a matrix organization.

Most contractors are **projectized**: the project manager builds the team and makes sure the work gets done.

## Managing project contstraints

Time - Cost - Scope - Resources - Quality - Risk

Any time your project changes, you'll need to know how that change affects *all* of the constraints.

Whenever you make **assumptions** about a project you're introducing **risk**.

Assumption -> Risk

If change affects project's constraints make sure that the change is *acceptable to stakeholders*.

A **hybrid** organization uses a mix of traditional and agile development practices.

## Don't reinvent the wheel

**Organizational process assets** keeps lessons learned from previous projects:

- **Process** (way to do the work)
- **Policies** (organization's rules)
- **Procedures** (practical guides)
- **Knowledge repositories**

You can't manage your project in a *vacuum*.

**Enterprise environmental factors:**

- **People** (skills and organizational culture)
- **Market** (organization's performance on the market)
- **Risk tolerance** (tolerant or risk-awerse)
- **Standards** (*government* standards)
- **Databases**

Projects need *clear* acceptance criteria.

It helps to write down concrete goals for project's constraints (time, cost, resources, quality, risk, and scope) as acceptance criteria up front.
