# The Process Framework and the Project Manager's Role

> "It all fits together"

All projects break down into **process groups** (steps).

Needs -> **Initiating** -> **Planning** -> (**Executing** / **Monitoring & Controlling**) -> **Closing** -> Success

Approaches for phases:

- Sequential
- Overlapping
- Iterating

If your project is **really big** (or due to external constraints), you can manage it in phases.

Each phase goes through *all five* process groups.

When your project has *sequential* phases, each phase starts after the previous phase 100% complete.

Project can also *overlap*.

Teams work independently on different parts of the project.

Overlapping *increased risk*:

- difficult to manage
- you might have to do a lot of *rework*

**Iteration** means executing one phase while planning the next (good for environments with inceertainty and change).

Single team performance *planning* for one phase while *executing* previous phase. Agile!

Whithin each process group are several individual **processes** (actual ways to do the work).
