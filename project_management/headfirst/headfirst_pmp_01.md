## Project management main components

| **Iterative** | **Incremental** |
| Planning up front and using repeated loops for changes indentification via feedbacks. Closer to **Predictive** | Small, usable increments through iterations and collecting feedback. The main difference from **Adaptive** is that increments needs to be finally combined. Closer to **Adaptive** |

**Hybrid** is any combination op predictive and adaptive approaches.

## Projects, programs and portofolio similarities

- All of them have a *set of proven processes, tools and techniques*.
- All of them add *business value* to the organization.
- All three need to balance of the **constraints** (shecdule, scope, resources).

**Project charter** gives

- a project description,
- a summary schedule,
- a business case, and
- an assigned project manager

Its purpose is to define goals and initiate work, to authorize the project.
