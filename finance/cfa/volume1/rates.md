# Module 1. Rates and Returns

## Interest rates and time value of money

> interpret interest rates as required rates of return, discount rates, or opportunity costs and explain an interest rate as the sum of a real risk-free rate and premiums that compensate investors for bearing distinct types of risk

Cash received today is preferred to cash promised in the future. 

An **interest rate (or yield)**, denoted *r*, is a rate of return that reflects the relationship between differently dated - timed - cash flows.

Interest rates can be interpret as:

- *Required rates of return*, or minimum rate accepted by investor
- *Discount rates*, that determines today's equivalent of future cash amount
- *Opportunity costs*. An **opportunity cost** is the value that investors forgo by choosing a course of action. 

### Determinants of Interest Rates

Interest rates are set by the forces of supply and demand, where investors supply funds, and borrowers demand their use.

*r* = Real risk-free interest rate + Inflation premium + Default risk premium + Liquidity premium + Maturity premium. (1)

The **real risk-free interest rate** is the single-period interest rate for a completely risk-free security if no inflation were expected. It reflects the time preference of individuals for current versus future real consumption.

Nominal risk-free rate = Real risk-free rate + inflation premium.

Many countries have short-term government debt whose interest rate can be considered to represent the nominal risk-free interest rate over that time horizon in that country (i.e. a 90-day US T-bill). Please note, that typically, interest rates are quoted in *annual* terms.

## Rates of Return

Financial assets are defined in terms of their return and risk characteristics.

Financial assets generate two types of return:

- periodic income (dividends or interest payments)
- capital gain or loss (price of the asset itself)

Returns can be measured over a single period or over multiple periods.

## Holding Period Return

A **holding period return**, R, is the return earned from holding an asset for a single specified period of time.

$R=\frac{(P_1-P_0)+I_1}{P_0}$, (1)

where the subscript indicates the time of the price or income; (*t*=0) is the beginning of the period; and (*t*=1) id the end of the period.

Return can be expressed in decimals (0.07), fractions (7/100), or as a percent (7 percent). They are all equivalent.

The one-year holding period return that is computed by compounding the three annual raturens:

$R = [(1+R_1) \times (1+R_2) \times (1+R_3)] - 1$,

where $R_1, R_2$, and $R_3$ are the three annual returns.
