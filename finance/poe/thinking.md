# Thinking Like an Economist

It is helpful to have an overview of how economists approach the world. 
This chapter discusses the field's methodology.

## The Economist as Scientist

The essence of science is the *scientific method* - the dispassionate (without prejudice) development and testing of theories about how the world works.

### The Scientific Method: Observation, Theory, and More Observation

In economics, conducting experiments is often impractical. 
Economists, like astronomers and evolutionary biologists, usually have to make do with whatever data the world happens to give them.

Economists pay close attention to the natural experiments offered by history.

### The Role of Assumptions

Assumptions can simplify the complex world and make it easier to understand. 
To study the effect of international trade, for example, we might assume that the world consists of only two countries and that each county produces only two goods. 
This allows us to focus our thinking on the essence of the problem.

The art in scientific thinking is deciding which assumptions to make.

Economists use different assumptions to answer different questions.
For studying the short-term effects of the government policy that changes the number of dollars in circulation, we may assume that prices do not change much, or are completely fixed.
For studying the long-term effects of the policy, however, we may assume that all prices are completely flexible.

### Economic Models

Economists use models that consists of diagrams and equations.
Economic models omit many details to allow us to see what is truly important.

All models simplify reality to improve our understanding of it.
