# Ten Principles of Economics

The word *economy* comes form the Greek word *oikonomos*, which means "one who manages a household".

Like a household, a society faces many decisions:

- allocate people and assets to various jobs
- allocate (distribute) the goods and services they produce

The management of society's resources is important because resources are scarce.

**Scarcity** is the limited nature of society's resources.

**Economics** is the study of how society manages its scarce resources.

In most societies, resources are allocated through the combined choices of millions of households and firms. Economists, therefore:

- study how people make decisions
- study how people interact with one another
- analyze the forces and trends that affect the economy as a whole 

## How people make decisions

The behavior of an economy reflects the behavior of the individuals who make up the economy. 

### Principle 1: People face trade-offs

"There ain't no such thing as a free lunch". To get something that we like, we usually have to give up something else that we also like. Making decisions requires trading off one goal against another.

- A student allocates her valuable resource - her time - between studying subjects. She also gives up time that can be spend to resting, sport, part-time job, etc.
- Parents allocate family income between food, clothes, vacation, retirement account, children's college education.

One classic society's trade-off is between "guns and butter". The more a society spends on national defense (guns), the less it can spend of consumer goods (butter) to raise the standard of living at home.

Another trade-off society faces is between efficiency and equality. **Efficiency** means that society is getting the maximum benefits from its scarce resources (size of economic pie). **Equality** means that those benefits are distributes uniformly among society's members (how the pie is divided).

When government policies are designed, these two goals often conflict. In example, more taxes for the rich reduces the reward for working hard which is hit the efficiency while helping equality. In other words, when government tries to cut the economic pie into more equal slices, the pie gets smaller.

Study of economics starts by acknowledging life's trade-offs.

### Principle 2: The cost of something is what you give up to get it

Because people face trade-offs, making decision requires comparing the costs and benefits of alternative courses of action.

The **opportunity cost** of an item is what you give up to get that item. When making any decision, decision makers should be aware of the opportunity costs that accompany each possible action.

In example, the larges cost of going to college - your time, that you can spend working in example. Or college athletes can earn millions if they drop out of school and play professional sports.

### Principle 3: Rational people think at the margin

Economists assume that people are rational. **Rational people** systematically and purposefully do the best they can to achieve their objectives, given the available opportunities.

Economists use the term **marginal change** to describe a small incremental adjustment to an exiting plan of action. Keep in mind that *margin* means "edge", so marginal changes are adjustments around the edges of what you are doing. Rational people often make decisions by comparing *marginal benefits* and *marginal costs*.

For example, the *average* cost of flying a passenger is $500, but the *marginal* cost is merely the cost of the can of soda that the extra standby passenger (for an empty seat) will consume. As long as the standby passenger pays more (say $300) than the marginal cost, selling the ticket is profitable.

A person's willingness to pay for a good is based on the marginal benefit of an extra unit of the good would yield. Water is essential, but its marginal cost of an extra cup is small because water is plentiful. By contrast, no one needs diamonds to survive, but they are so rare, so people consider the marginal benefit of an extra diamond to be large.

A rational decision maker takes an action if and only if the marginal benefit of the action exceeds the marginal cost.

### Principle 4: People respond to incentives

An **incentive** is something (such as the prospect of a punishment or reward) that induces a person to act. Because rational people make decisions by comparing costs and benefits, they respond to incentives.

Incentives are key to analyzing how markets work. For example, a higher price in a market provides an incentive for buyers to consume less and an incentive for  sellers to produce more.

Many policies change the cost or benefits that people face and, as a result, alter their behavior. A tax on gasoline can encourage people to drive smaller cars, to carpool, take public transportation, etc.

When policymakers fail to consider how their policies affect incentives, they often end up facing unintended consequences. For example, public policy regarding auto safety alters a driver's cost-benefit calculation of a safer driving. Drivers start to drive faster which lead to a larger number of accidents.

When analyzing any policy, we must consider not only the direct effects but also the less obvious indirect effects that work through incentives. If the policy changes incentives, it will cause people to alter their behavior.

## How people Interact

These principles concern how people interact with one another

### Principle 5: Trade can make everyone better off

It is easy to be misled when thinking about competition among countries. Trade between two counties can make each country better off.

In example each family in an economy competes with all other families to get better job or buy the best goods at the lowest prices. Being in isolation requires growing own food, make own clothes, etc. Trade allows each person to specialize in the activities she does best.

Trade allows countries to specialize in what they do best and to enjoy a greater variety of goods and services at lower cost.

### Principle 6: Markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity

In centrally planned economies central planners decided what goods and services were produced, how much was produced, and who produced and consumed these goods and services.

In contrast, **market economy** is an economy that allocated resources through the decentralized decisions of many firms and households as they interact in markets for goods and services. There firms and households interact in the marketplace, where prices and self-interest guide their decisions.

Despite decentralized decision making and self-interest decision makers, market economies promote overall economic well-being.

Adam Smith said that households and firms interacting in markets act as if they are guided by  an "invisible hand" that leads them to desirable market outcomes. Smith said that participants in the economy are motivated by self-interest and that the "invisible hand" of the marketplace guides this self-interest into promoting general economic well-being.

Prices are the instrument with which the invisible hand directs economics activity. Prices influence buyers decisions how much to demand, and sellers - how much to supply. As a result, market prices reflect:

- the value of a good to society
- the cost to society of making the good

When a government prevent prices from adjusting naturally to supply and demand, it impedes the invisible hand's ability to coordinate the decisions of the households and firms that make up an economy. Thus why taxes adversely affect allocation of resources: they distort prices and thus the decisions of households and firms.

Vigorous competition among producers makes a market work well for consumers.

For example, Uber's surge pricing increases consumer well-being. Surge pricing makes consumers pay more at times, but because Uber drivers respond to incentives, it also increases the quantity of car services supplied when they are most needed. Surge pricing also helps allocate the service to those consumers who value them most highly and reduces the costs of searching and waiting for a car.

### Principle 7: Governments can sometimes improve market outcomes

One reason we need government is that the invisible hand can work its magic only if the government enforces the rules and maintains the institutions that are key to a market economy. Most important, market economies need institutions to enforce **property rights** so individuals can own and control scarce resources.

We all rely on government-provided police and courts to enforce our rights over the things we produce - and the invisible hand counts on our ability to enforce those rights.

Government intervenes in the economy and changes the allocation of resources as the invisible hand powerful, but not omnipotent:

- to promote efficiency (to enlarge the economic pie)
- to promote equality (to change how the pie is divided)

The invisible hand usually allocates resources efficiently, but not always. **Market failure** is a situation in which a market left on its own fails to allocate resources efficiently.

Some of the possible causes of market failure are:

- **externality**: the impact of one person's actions on the well-being of a bystander. The classic is pollution - market on its own may fail to take into account harm of the factory pollution to citizen's health.

- **market power**: the ability of a single economic actor (or small group of actors) to have a substantial influence on market prices. For example, owner of the only water well in town is not subject to the rigorous competition and, thus, can charge a higher price.

Well-designed public policy can enhance economic efficiency.

The invisible hand can leave sizable disparities in economic well-being. A market economy rewards people according to their ability to produce things that other people are willing to pay for. In practice, many public policies, such as the income tax and the welfare system, aim to achieve a more equal distribution of economic well-being.

To say that the government *can* improve on market outcomes does not mean that it always *will*. People aren't angels, political processes are imperfect, self-interested or poorly informed leaders, etc.

## How the Economy as a whole works

The last three principles concern the workings of the economy as a whole.

### Principle 8: A country's standard of living depends on its ability to produce goods and services

### Principle 9: Prices rise when the government prints too much money

### Principle 10: Society faces a short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment
