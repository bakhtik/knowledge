# The Principles of Economics

The word *economy* comes form the Greek word *oikonomos*, which means "one who manages a household".

Like a household, a society faces many decisions:

- allocate people and assets to various jobs
- allocate (distribute) the goods and services they produce

The management of society's resources is important because resources are scarce.

**Scarcity** is the limited nature of society's resources.

**Economics** is the study of how society manages its scarce resources.

In most societies, resources are allocated through the combined choices of millions of households and firms. Economists, therefore:

- study how people make decisions
- study how people interact with one another
- analyze the forces and trends that affect the economy as a whole 

## How people make decisions

The behavior of an economy reflects the behavior of the individuals who make up the economy. 

### Principle 1: People face trade-offs

"There ain't no such thing as a free lunch". To get something that we like, we usually have to give up something else that we also like. Making decisions requires trading off one goal against another.

- A student allocates her valuable resource - her time - between studying subjects. She also gives up time that can be spend to resting, sport, part-time job, etc.
- Parents allocate family income between food, clothes, vacation, retirement account, children's college education.

One classic society's trade-off is between "guns and butter". The more a society spends on national defense (guns), the less it can spend of consumer goods (butter) to raise the standard of living at home.

Another trade-off society faces is between efficiency and equality. **Efficiency** means that society is getting the maximum benefits from its scarce resources (size of economic pie). **Equality** means that those benefits are distributes uniformly among society's members (how the pie is divided).

When government policies are designed, these two goals often conflict. In example, more taxes for the rich reduces the reward for working hard which is hit the efficiency while helping equality. In other words, when government tries to cut the economic pie into more equal slices, the pie gets smaller.

Study of economics starts by acknowledging life's trade-offs.

### Principle 2: The cost of something is what you give up to get it

### Principle 3: Rational people think at the margin

### Principle 4: People respond to incentives

## How people react

These principles concern how people interact with one another

### Principle 5: Trade can make everyone better off

### Principle 6: Markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity

### Principle 7: Governments can sometimes improve market outcomes

## How the Economy as a whole works

The last three principles concern the workings of the economy as a whole.

### Principle 8: A country's standard of living depends on its ability to produce goods and services

### Principle 9: Prices rise when the government prints too much money

### Principle 10: Society faces a short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment
