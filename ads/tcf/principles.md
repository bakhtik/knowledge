# TCF Standardisation Principles

## Definitions

A Publisher
: an owner or operator of online content or services where personal data is collected and used by third-party companies (vendors) for digital advertising, audience measurement, or content personalization.

A Consent Management Platform (CMP)
: a software or solution provider that develops notice (e.g. cookie banners) to inform users and capture their preferences with respect to the processing of their personal data.

A Vendor
: a company that does not ordinary have direct access to end-users of publishers. Vendors can be Ad servers, measurement providers, advertising agencies, DSPs, SSPs, and more.

## Information that should be provided to users about vendors

Vendors shall disclose to users:

- vendor's identity
- link to the vendor's privacy policy
- the duration of the cookies they rely on
- non-cookie method for accessing user's devices (e.g. mobile identifiers)
- the data processing purposes and associated legal bases
- retention period of data collected
- categories of data collected

Once a vendor is registered, all the information will be included in the publicly available "Global Vendor List" (GVL). The GVL serves as a central and up-to-date information repository available to Publishers and their CMP when they select vendors they work with and then disclose information and provide choices to users about the third  parties vendors they selected.

CMPs capture users' choices in the form of a "TC String" - an open-source binary format, that represents users' privacy preferences.

## TCF for Publishers

Publishers shall perform the following:

- Either act as a CMP (be registered as CMP) or use registered CMP service
- Select and control the vendors they want to work with (an unjustifiably large number of vendors can impact users' ability to make choices)
- Undertake to update vendor-partners' scripts that store/process personal data
- Forward information about users' choices to vendors-partners
- Provide users with the ability to change privacy preferences

## TCF for CMP

CMPs shall perform the following:

- Provide users with transparency and choices into the vendors that a publisher has selected to work with
- Provide transparency and choices into the vendors purposes
- Capture and store users' choices in the form of a "TC String"
- Ensure that users' choices can be communicated to vendors

## TCF for Vendors

Vendors shall perform the following:

- Provide and maintain information for GVL
- Update software (scripts) that stores/precesses users' personal data in order to
  - Receive users' choices in real-time
  - Respect such choices
- Ensure they don't transmit personal data to another vendors unless the receiving vendor has a legal basis for processing
