# Every page is the page one

## Introduction

People's behavior on the Web follows a pattern similar to the optimal foraging patterns of wild animals - *information foraging*. Information seekers try to find adequate information with the minimum expenditure of mental energy.

The key concept in information foraging is *information scent*. The information forager will move on to a different source when scent grows weak, he search information with the nose of a predator.

In the paper world, a book is an *information patch*, but it is expensive to move to a different patch. In the Web, moving form one patch to another costs nothing. So the optimal strategy is not to hunt out one patch, like a fox for a big rabbit, but to more on to a fresh patch ("small rabbit").

The better search engines highlight good sites, the **less time users will spend on any one site.**

Always-on connections encourage **information snaking**, where users go online briefly, looking for quick answers. The upside is that users will **visit more frequently**.

There are two strategies for content that needs to be used in combination:

- content shall look like a **nutritious meal**
- content shall signal that it's an **easy catch**

## Every page is page one

The informational snaking behavior leads to the fact that every page becomes a new page one.

There is no "Start Here" in the Web. User is teleported into some page that is his page one. Every page is page one.

The Web is a hypertext medium consisting of a navigable network of interconnected pages.
