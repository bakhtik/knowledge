# Stop for Big Moments

Stop effects: don't skimp on them!

An example, "hit stop". It refers to a brief stop in the action that occurs, for example, when hitting an opponent. Whether or not it's there will completely change how heavy a hit feels, so it's pretty important effect.

"Boss stop" refers to the stop effect you see when you defeat a boss. For example, when you defeat a boss, the screen can stop and flash for a moment. This is vital for letting the player really *feel* that impact.

The action can also be stopped when player loses a life.

Stop effect should be used all over the place, regardless of genre. In a scrolling shoot' em ups, it's very easy to die without even realizing. It's a real missed opportunity.

You can stop the screen for a second the moment you get hit. A pause can clearly show the point of impact, giving you plenty of that "oh no!" feeling.

You can use the following tools:

- No effect
- Stop
- Stop + Shake
- Stop + Shake + Slow Motion

In your game's big moments, *stop*!

Let your players *feel* those moments of success - or defeat.

It's a relatively easy effect to implement, so why not?
