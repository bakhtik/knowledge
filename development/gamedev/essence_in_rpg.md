# Game Essence in Role-Playing Games

One thing RPGs need is an adventure into unknown dangers. 

The deeper you go, the stronger and scarier enemies become. But in the search for an eve greater reward, you push on anyway:

- Do you press your luck?
- Or get out while you still can?

Falling in battle would mean losing all the spoils you've found, so the risk and reward is clear.

Games that let you exit dungeons at will or not stress over resource management could be said to be more "casual". By increasing the difficulty of individual battles, they can still hit a nice balance.

As for combat, action RPGs have to take the balance of action scenes into consideration, so let's talk about turn-based battles for now.

When an enemy appears, first, the player sizes it up based on how it looks and acts. If you give something a shot and it works, you gain experience. Exploiting enemy weaknesses to maximize your damage output - that's both strategy *and* game essence at play.

For a more casual game, it might be best not to make things too complex.

There are two conventional core elements of RPG "essence": exploration and combat. But RPGs are a vast and complex genre. So don't let existing conventions limit how you design your push and pull!
