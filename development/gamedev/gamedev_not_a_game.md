# Game Development Isn't a Game

Masahiro Sakurai creates games because that's what him best at. Liking games, or liking to make them is lower down the list for him.

The job of a game developer is to create games, but the work itself is not a game.

It's one thing if you're making games as a hobby. But once money, sales, and numbers get involved, you need to approach it like any other job.

Being a pro means being light on your feet and ready to respond to demand. Even if it's not your cup of tea, a job is still a job - you have to do it, and try to do it well.

Of course, as with any job, it's good to find fun where you can - to try and figure out what makes the work interesting and rewarding.

You should put aside personal preferences when making games. Do not design games for yourself.

View every project that comes your way as an assignment in which you create a game to fit a certain genre or goal.

But still, the most important thing is to find the fun in it. Masahuro Sakurai has enjoyed his games, and the process of making them. He often plays them after release, too.

Once you understand what makes games fun, you'll be able to create all kinds of experiences regardless of your own preferences.

No matter what kind of games a developer makes, we all have one goal in mind: **to entertain our players.** Whatever you do, never lose sight of that goal.

**Entertain Players**
