# Risk and Reward

Game Essence

Game essence is all the elements that make a game fun. It's a game's "push and pull", or "risk and reward".

As an example, lets discuss Risk and Reward in "Space Invaders".

"No risk, no reward" state is when player's cannon and invader's ship are not in the same vertical line, so both of them cannot hit each other.

"Risk increases and Reward almost in reach" state when user get closer to the invader, to that more likely we are get hit by its beams.

"Risk: Increases further, Reward: Enemy can be defeated" state when enemy can hit us, but we can finally hit the enemy and get our well-deserved reward.

**Take Risks to Get Rewards** is the core of game essence!

**Strategy** is essentially the same thing through a different lens.

**Game Essence** = The **fun** of managing risks/getting rewards
**Strategy** = **How** you manage risks/get rewards

One is about mechanics, the other is about the player.

Due to the invader ship moves while attacking, it's attack zone is not vertical but sloped. Thus when player pursues invader, he put himself for danger for nothing, when he intercepts ship, then he can hit invader with small risk to be hit.

Space Invaders Strategy: **Don't Pursue, Intercept"**

Your cannon's width is key to game balance, because it determines how great your risk is. This distance determines risk. This is a key element of game essence!

Mechanics that vary risk also contribute to game essence, they important to game balance. Like ability to hide halfway under a bunker.

Strategy is all about using ingenuity to reduce risks and get rewards.

Think carefully about risk and reward when making a game.

Space Invader's "Wall of Death" is a state of ultimate risk, ultimate reward.

Let's look at Super Mario Bros.

Stomping on enemies and using then to attack is a big part of the fun of this classic.

Fun is being able to hit Koopa Troopa at a high level of risk being damaged and the use its shell to attack other enemies.

It's important to note that as you increase "game essence", you reduce a game's broad appeal.
