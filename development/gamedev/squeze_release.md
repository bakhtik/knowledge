# Squeeze and Release

Enemies show up, and the player defeats them. That concept can serve as the basis for a simple game, but let's take a look at why that is.

## Stress and Relief

A funny thing about games is how they stress you out in order to then provide relief. It's a core element of what makes games fun.

Stress on its own isn't fun, but if you really *squeeze* a player, then *whoosh!* set them free, it can bring great satisfaction.

It feels good to be under heavy pressure, then suddenly be freed of all that stress.

## Apply Stress

Apply some kind of stress.

Whether that's an enemy, an obstacle, or a puzzle, all it has to do is impede the player's progress. Then, by releasing that stress, they'll feel great.

But that's just the first step.

## Reward the Player!

If they can pass this challenge, we want to reward the player with new ways to more effectively relieve stress.

For example, experience points or new skills would prepare the player to face stronger foes.

Currency to buy better equipment is another good reward.

Just letting the player progress is a reward in and of itself, but providing the player with choice can really boost that "game essence".

**Apply stress, allow for release, and prepare players for what's next.** By considering this flow, you might find ways to make your game even more fun.
