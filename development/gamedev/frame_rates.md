# Frame Rates

Frame rate measures how often the screen is redrawn.

On standard televisions, the screen is redrawn or "refreshed" 60 times each second - that's 60 frames per second (fps).

In games, these frames are often used as a unit of time.

Distance = Time * Speed.

60 fps and 30 fps are quite different both in how they look and how smoothly they control.

60 fps is an ideal frame rate when possible, but 30 fps is also a common standard. After all, to draw twice as many frames, you'd have to sacrifice half your visual performance. And 30 fps is still more than adequate for playing games.

Some games have variable frame rate reducing frames when the processor can't keep up. The game itself isn't slowing down - it's just redrawing the screen less often.

Monitor shall support desired frame rate.

Frame rate is about time, the number of images, and resolution, with 60 fps being a general standard.
