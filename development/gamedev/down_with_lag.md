# Down with Lag!

Let's talk about player environment.

Even if your game has great response time, there' always one monster ready to rear its ugly head: the much-maligned input delay, or "lag".

When we play games, we're technically seeing images the console created in the past. If that delay is too great, it can really ruin the play experience, so naturally, we want to minimize it.

If you notice a slight delay, your TV settings may be the culprit.

Lag can manifest in two different ways:

- display latency
- response time

Response time describes how long it takes for a TV to change a pixel's color.

Display latency can be caused by TV's various post-processing effects that help improve picture quality and clarity. But with Game Mode and Low Latency Mode, we can bypass that processing to deliver the image more quickly.

TV specs usually show display time listed in milliseconds. With a 60 fps video output, a delay of 16.67 ms equates to one frame.
