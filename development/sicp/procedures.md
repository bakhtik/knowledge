# Procedures and the Processes They Generate

We have now considered the elements of programming:

- primitive expressions
- combination of the expressions
- abstracting of the composite operations using compound procedures

But we still lack of knowledge:

- common patterns of usage
- of which procedures are worth defining
- to predict the consequences of executing a procedure

The ability to visualize the consequences of the actions under consideration is crucial to become an expert programmer.

To become experts, we must learn to visualize the processes generated by various types of procedures. Only after we have developed such a skill can we learn to reliably construct programs that exhibit the desired behavior.

A procedure is a pattern for the *local evolution* of a computational process. It specifies how each stage of the process is built upon the previous stage. We would like to be able to make statements about the overall, or *global*, behavior of a process whose local evolution has been specified by a procedure.

We will examine some common "shapes" for processes generated by simple procedures and will see how these processes consume computational resources of time and space.
