> The act of mind dealing with simple ideas
> 1. **Complex idea:** combining several simple ideas into one compound one.
> 2. **Relations:** view two ideas (simple or complex) at once, without uniting them.
> 3. **Abstraction:** separating ideas from all other ideas that accompany them in real existence.

*A computational process* is an abstract being that manipulate other abstract things called *data* as it evolves.

*A program* is s pattern of rules that direct the evolution of a process.

The programs we use to conjure processes are like a sorcerer's spells. They are carefully composed from symbolic expressions in arcane and esoteric *programming languages* that prescribe the tasks we want our processes to perform.

Well designed computational system are designed in a modular manner, so that the parts can be constructed, replaced, and debugged separately.

## Programming in Lisp

Lisp (acronym for "list processing") was invented in the late 1950s as a formalism for reasoning about the use of *recursion equations*, as a model for computation.

A List *interpreter* is a machine that carries out processes described in the List language.

*Scheme* is one of the dialects of the Lisp.

Lisp is a language of choice for OS shell languages and for extension languages for editors.

The most significant of the language features is the fact that Lisp descriptions of processes, called *procedures*, can themselves be represented and manipulated as Lisp data.
