# Usability law #1

**Don't make me think!**

Web page shall be *self-evident (obvious)*.

When creating the web-page, get rid of the question marks that can be ballooned over users' heads.
People don't *like* to puzzle over how to do things.

Each page shall be self-evident, so that user will know what it is and how to use it.

If you can't make the something self-evident - make it at least *self-explanatory* (it takes a *little* thought to "get it") through:

- appearance (size, color, and layout).
- well-chosen names.
- *small* amount of carefully crafted  text.
