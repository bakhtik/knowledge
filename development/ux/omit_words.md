# Omit ~~needless~~ words

## The art of not writing for the web

> Get rid of half of the words on each page,
> then get rid of half of what's left.

A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences.

Concise writing:

- reduces the noise level.
- makes the useful content more prominent.
- allows see more at a glance without scrolling.

## Happy talk must die

Happy talk = introductory text (" welcome blah blah blah").

It conveys no useful information, and it focuses on saying how great we are, as opposed to explaining what makes us great.

You should eliminate as much content-free happy talk as possible.

## Instructions must die

No one is going to read instructions - at least not until after repeated attempts at "muddling through" have failed.

Your objective is to eliminate instructions entirely by making everything self-explanatory. When instructions are absolutely necessary, cut them back to the bare minimum.
