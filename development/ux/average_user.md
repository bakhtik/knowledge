## Why most arguments about usability are a waste of time, and how to avoid them

Most Web teams spend a lot of time in unsuccessful attempts of making decisions about usability questions.

These endless discussions can be called "religious debates":

- every participants has own strong opinions that cannot be proven
- end result will not change anybody's point of view

## Everybody likes this

As individuals, all the Web team members are the Web users. So all of them has strong personal convictions about what makes for a good Web site.

We tend to think that most users are like us.

## Farmer vs. cowmen

On the top of personal passion, there's a *professional passion*. 

Depending on the specialization, every team member has certain point of interest and things that emits endorphins for them:

- designers enjoy pleasant visual experiences
- developers tend to like complexity

These differences in perspective often lead to conflict during establishing design priorities.

And there is a clash between the cultures of hype and craft:

- **The hype culture:** business people that focused on increasing value for the shareholders.
- **The craft culture:** designers and developers who needs to make this happen.

## The myth of the Average User

There is no Average User.

**All web users are unique and all web use is basically idiosyncratic.**

The more you watch users and listen to their intentions, motivations, and thought processes, the more you realize that users' Web behavior relies on a lot of variables.

There are no simple "right answers", but there is good, integrated design that fills a need - carefully though out, well executed and tested.

## The antidote for religious debates

It is not productive to ask questions like "Do most people like this widget?" The right kind of question to ask is "Does *this* widget with *these* elements and *this* wording in *this* context on *this* page create a good experience for most of the people who are likely to use *this* site?"

And there is only one way to answer that kind of question: **testing**.
