# Usability testing

## Keeping testing simple - so do enough of it

> Why didn't we do this sooner?

If somebody asked to do usability testing of the site launching in two weeks, when it was almost certainly a request for a disaster check.

If it was two months, then odds were that this was some internal debates about things like aesthetics.

People often test to decide which color drapes are best, only to learn that they forgot to put windows in the room.

This is how a lot of usability testing gets done: too little, too late, and for all the wrong reasons.

## Repeat after me: Focus groups are not usability tests

- In a **focus group**, a small group of people (5 to 10) sit around a table and talk about things, like their opinions about product, their past experience with them, or their reaction to new concepts. Focus groups are good for quickly getting a sampling of users' feelings and opinions about things. This is great to determine audience wants and needs.
- **Usability tests** are about watching one person at a time try to use something (Web site, prototype) to do typical tasks so you can detect and fix the things that confuse or frustrate them.

The main difference is that in usability tests, you watch people actually *use* things, instead of just listening to them talk about them.

Basically, you should use focus groups to get a product idea *before* designing and building the product.

## Several true things about usability testing

- **If you want a great site, you've got to test.** The only way to find out if it really works is to watch other people try to use it.
- **Testing one user is 100 percent better than testing none.** Always doing a live usability test at the beginning so that people can see that it's very easy to do and it always produced valuable insights.
- **Testing one user early in the project is better that testing 50 near the end.** Any mistakes you can correct early in the process will save you trouble down the line.

## Do-it-yourself usability testing

The basic idea of usability testing is pretty simple: if you want to know whether something is easy enough to use, watch some people they try to use it and note where they run into problems.

If you can't hire a professional to do the testing, do it yourself.

|   | Do-it-yourself testing |
| - | - |
| Time spent for each round of testing | One morning a month includes testing, debriefing, and deciding what to fix |
| When do you test? | Continually, throughout the development process |
| Number of rounds of testing | One every month |
| Number of participants in each round | Three |
| Now do you choose the participants? | Recruit loosely, if necessary. Doing frequent testing is more important that testing "actual" users |
| Where do you test? | On-site, with observers in a conference room using screen sharing software to watch |
| Who watches? | half day on-site testing means more people can see the test "live" |
| Reporting | A 1-2 page email summarizes decisions made during the team's debriefing |
| Who identifies the problems? | The entire development team and any interested stakeholders meet over lunch the same day to compare notes and decide what to fix |
| Primary purpose | Identify the most serious problems and commit to fixing them before the next round of testing |
Out-of-pocket costs | A few hundred dollars or less per round |

## How often should you test?
