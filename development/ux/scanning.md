# Users' behavior

**Scanning, satisficing, and muddling through.**

User's reality is close to "billboard going by at 60 km an hour"

Users most of the time:

- *glance* at each new page.
- **scan** *some* text.
- click on the first link that catches their interest.

There are large parts of the page they don't even look at.

Facts of life:

1. We don't read pages. We scan them. We're on a mission
2. We don't make optimal choices. We *satisfice* (choose the *first reasonable option*)
3. We don't figure out how things work. We muddle through

People usually don't read the instructions. Instead we forge ahead and muddle through.

If your audience is going to act like you're designing billboards, then design great billboards.
