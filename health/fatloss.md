## How does fat loss work?

Daily energy expenditure:

- the thermic effect of food (cost of digestion)
- basal metabolic rate (chemical reactions in organism)
- physical activity

For fat loss to occur, energy intake must be less than energy expenditure.

Exercise is an advantageous adjunct to diet for achieving and maintaining weight loss, although exercise alone is an inefficient way to induce significant weight loss. Aerobic exercise is more effective than resistance exercise. Also, resistance exercise can reduce muscle loss associated with weight loss.

Recent evidence suggests that there is a plateau in total energy expenditure at high levels of physical activity, meaning that exercising more leads to a corresponding increase in total energy expenditure up to a point.

The optimal strategy for promoting weight loss is a combination of a hypocaloric diet and adequate amounts of exercise (i.e., enough to facilitate the rate of weight loss the individual is pursuing while maintaining muscle mass).

## How could diet affect fat loss?

There are no meaningful differences in fat loss between diets that vary in carbohydrate and fat content, as long as their protein and calorie content is equal.

Certain dietary factors can influence fat loss via their effects on energy expenditure, hunger, and satiety, and thus energy intake:

- ultraprocessed foods: increase ad libitum energy intake
- protein: helps to preserve muscle during weight loss (and thus preserve basal metabolic rate), and may reduce hunger and prolong satiety
- fiber: reduces hunger and prolong satiety

The best fat-loss diet qualities:

- it's *hypocaloric*: makes you eat less than burn
- it's *sustainable*: fits food preferences and lifestyle well enough that adherence is possible
