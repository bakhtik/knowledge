## Fitness basics

Physical activity can reduce your risk of chronic disease, improve your balance and coordination, help you lose weight, and even boost your self-esteem.

[U.S.HSS](https://www.hhs.gov) recommendations:

- **Aerobic activity:**
  - at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity a week, or
  - at least 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity a week
  - 300 minutes or more of moderate aerobic activity a week to assist a weight loss
- **Strength training.** Do strength training exercises for all major muscle groups at least two times a week. Aim to do a single set of each exercise using a weight or resistance level heavy enough to tire your muscles after about 12 to 15 repetitions.

### Moderate aerobic activity

Moderate activity feels somewhat hard:

- Your breathing quickens, but you're not out of breath.
- You start to lightly sweat after about 10 minutes of activity.
- You can talk to someone, but you can't sing.

### Vigorous exercise intensity

Vigorous activity feels challenging:

- Your breathing is deep and rapid.
- You start to sweat after only a few minutes of activity.
- You can't say more than a few words without pausing for breath.

## Aerobic activity

Regular aerobic activity, such as walking, bicycling or swimming, can help you live longer and healthier.

### How your body responds to aerobic exercise

During aerobic activity, you repeatedly move large muscles in your arms, legs and hips.

You'll breathe faster and more deeply. This maximizes the amount of oxygen in your blood. Your heart will beat faster, which increases blood flow to your muscles and back to your lungs.

Capillaries will widen to deliver more oxygen to your muscles and carry away waste products, such as carbon dioxide and lactic acid.

### Start slowly

When you're ready to begin exercising, start slowly. From 5 minutes walking in the morning and the evening. Soon, you could be walking briskly for at least 30 minutes a day, five days a week. Also aim to sit less and move more during the day.

Short of time? Try a high-intensity interval training workout. In interval training, you alternate between short periods of intense activity and longer periods of less intense activity.

Other options for aerobic exercise could include cross-country skiing, aerobic dancing, swimming, stair climbing, bicycling, jogging, elliptical training or rowing.

### Gauging intensity using your heart rate

The maximum heart rate is the upper limit of what your heart and cardiovascular system, can handle during physical activity.

The maximum heart rate = 208 - age x 0.7 (i.e. MHR(42) = 208 - 42 x 0.7 = 178.6). This is the average maximum number of times the heart should beat each minute during exercise.

[The American Heart Association](https://www.heart.org) generally recommends these heart rate targets:

- Moderate exercise intensity: 50% to about 70% of your maximum heart rate.
- Vigorous exercise intensity: 70% to about 85% of your maximum heart rate.

#### How to find your target heart rate zone

You can estimate of your target heart rate zone using the heart rate reserve (HRR) method.

- Calculate your heart rate reserve (HRR):

    HRR = maximum heart rate - resting heart rate (my HRR = 62 BPM) = 178.6 - 62 = 116.6
- Multiply HRR be percentage of target rate (0.5, 0.7, or 0.85). Add your resting heart rate to the number.

**My target heart rate zones:**

- 50%: HRR x 0.5 + RHR = 116.6 x 0.5 + 62 = 120
- 70%: HRR x 0.7 + RHR = 116.6 x 0.75 + 62 = 149
- 85%: HRR x 0.85 + RHR = 116.6 x 0.85 + 62 = 161

So, follow this heart rate targets:

- **target heart rate zone** for **moderate** exercise: **120 to 150**
- **target heart rate zone** for **vigorous** exercise: **150 to 160**

#### Target heart rate tips

It's important to note that maximum heart rate is only a general guide.

Generally, only elite athletes may need to get a very specific range and most casual athletes don't need such specific ranges.

Also note that many types of medicines, including some medicines to lower blood pressure, can lower your maximum heart rate, and then lower your target heart rate zone.

Research shows that interval training, which includes short bouts (around 20 seconds to 4 minutes) of higher intensity exercise between periods of longer, less strenuous exercise throughout a workout, is well tolerated. This type of training is very effective at increasing heart and blood vessel, also called cardiovascular, fitness and helping with weight loss.

## Exercises

### Navy Seal Burpees

1. In the starting position, stand with your feet shoulder width apart.
2. Squat down and place your hands on the ground.
3. Jump legs backward into a push up position (or plank). Perform a push up.
4. At the top of your push up, bring your right knee out to touch your right elbow. Return to a plank.
5. Repeat the same thing on the left side—left knee to left elbow.
6. Jump back to a standing position.
7. Extend your hips to jump and clap your hands overhead.
8. That’s one rep. Now, repeat.

Modification:

Do three push ups on each repetition; one where you’d normally do a push-up, then again in between each mountain climber.
