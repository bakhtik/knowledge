No single formula fits everyone. But knowing more about your body's need for fluids will help you estimate how much water to drink each day.

## What are the health benefits of water?

Up to 70% of your body weight is a water. Your body depends on water to survive.

Every cell, tissue and organ in your body needs water to work properly.

Lack of water can lead to dehydration â€” a condition that occurs when you don't have enough water in your body to carry out normal functions.

## How much water do you need?

Every day you lose water through your breath, perspiration, urine and bowel movements. For your body to function properly, you must replenish its water supply by consuming beverages and foods that contain water.

U.S. [NASEM](https://www.nationalacademies.org) recommends

- for men: 3.7 litres of fluid (3 litres in form of drinks)
- for women: 2.7 litres of fluid

Remember, that about 20% of daily fluid intake usually comes from food. For example, many fruits and vegetables, such as watermelon and spinach, are almost 100% water by weight.

## The advice to drink 8 glasses a day

It's reasonable but shall be modified based on these factors:

- **Exercise:** drink extra water before, during, and after a workout
- **Environment:** hot and humid weather, high attitudes lead to dehydration
- **Overall health:** drink more water when you have a fever

## How do I know if I'm drinking enough?

Your fluid intake is probably adequate if:

- You rarely feel thirsty
- Your urine is colorless or light yellow

It's a good idea to drink a glass of water:

- With each meal and between meals
- Before, during and after exercise
- If you feel thirsty
